With the increasing reliance of scientific research on infrastructural and analytical software, foundational tools in life sciences have outgrown individual labs and institutes in terms of their scale and impact. That has encouraged us to start something more than a code repository for an exciting new project â€“ we are starting a new organisation to maintain and support foundational tools in the life sciences.

Our primary experience lies in the field of computational genomics and lately single-cell sequencing technologies, and this has defined our scope and focus in the very beginning of our journey that we have called {{< rawhtml >}}<span class="backticked">scverse</span>{{< /rawhtml >}}.

## What this is about

{{< rawhtml >}}<span class="backticked">scverse</span>{{< /rawhtml >}} is a consortium for joint maintenance of core packages in omics data analysis in life sciences. It has been founded to ensure the long-term maintenance of the core infrastructure in the field.

## What we are busy with

While we're continuing to work on the scverse libraries, we're trying to improve how they work and are tested together.

There are already a few visible outcomes of our joint work including improved {{< rawhtml >}}<a href="https://mudata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html#v0-1-2" target="_blank">mudata performance</a>{{< /rawhtml >}} and {{< rawhtml >}}<a href="https://mudata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">mudata documentation</a>{{< /rawhtml >}}. Things like rich representation for AnnData objects and MuData integration in scvi-tools are work in progress.

## What is coming next

We're particularly excited about the community coming together for this effort with so many brilliant people involved who design tools, write code, manage and analyse data, visualise results. Please feel invited to {{< rawhtml >}}<a href="https://discourse.scverse.org/" target="_blank">join us on Discourse</a>{{< /rawhtml >}}, and make sure to {{< rawhtml >}}<a href="https://twitter.com/scanpy_team" target="_blank">follow us on Twitter</a>{{< /rawhtml >}} to keep track of scverse updates.
